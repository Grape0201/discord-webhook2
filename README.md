A Rust library to interact with advanced discord webhooks.

Why use this one over the others?

While there are multiple other libraries,
most of them are either unmaintained or lack certain features...

Supports:

- [X] Embeds
- [X] Handling message ids
- [X] Uploading files/extra data
- [X] Sending, getting, editing and deleting messages
- [X] Polls
- [X] Emojis

### Example

A basic "Hello World" using `discord-webhook2`:

```rust
use discord_webhook2::{DiscordWebhook, Message};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let webhook = DiscordWebhook::new("discord webhook url").unwrap();

    webhook.send(&Message::new(|message| message
        .content("Hello World!")
    )).await.unwrap();
}
```

More examples can be found in the examples
directory [discord-webhook2/examples](https://github.com/theaddonn/discord-webhook2/tree/main/examples).
